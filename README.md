### Description
This project lets you visualize your time tracking data from a json file generated by this simple timetracker tool [ti](https://github.com/tbekolay/ti) on a nice and intuitive timeline. We use Google visualization as submodule to keep track of any changes in the future. 

### Setup
Clone this project to your local computer at a desired location:  
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sriharshamadala/ti-visualization.git
$ cd ti-visualization
```

#### Method 1
We have to update the submodule:
```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Execute our main python script by passing the json file containing the data as an argument:
```shell
$ python MyScript.py TimeTrackerData.json > timeline.html
```
Open _timeline.html_ in your browser to visulaize your data. Hover over any project to see more details.

#### Method 2
Execute the shell script setup.sh by passing the json file containing the data as an argument. This shell script basically does everything in Method 1.
```shell
$ setup.sh TimeTrackerData.json timeline.html
```
If the shell script fails to generate the output follow Method 1.

#### Note:
* Tasks performed on weekends are highlighted in red.
* Each task description is preceeded by the number of hours spent on that particular task. The format is _hours_._minutes_.

For any issues with executing the script or feature requests please create an issue here.
